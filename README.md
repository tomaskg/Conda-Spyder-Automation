## Disclaimer

âš  **Please note that this script currently only supports Linux.**

Work is currently underway to make the script compatible with macOS and Windows operating systems. Once the script is updated to support additional platforms, instructions for running it on macOS and Windows will be provided.

In the meantime, if you have access to a Linux machine, you can still use this script to install and set up the environment with Spyder.

If you encounter any issues or have any questions, feel free to open an issue in this repository. We appreciate your feedback as we work towards broader platform compatibility.

To use this script, follow these steps:

1. Save the script in a file named `install_spyder.sh`.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the script.
3. Give the script execute permission: `chmod +x install_spyder.sh`.
4. Run the script: `./install_spyder.sh`.

After the script finishes, you can open a new terminal and use the `spy` command to run Spyder.
